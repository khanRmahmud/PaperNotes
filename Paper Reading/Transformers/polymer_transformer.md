 - **Keywords and abstract**:
    - Shape memory polymers (SMP).
    - Thermomechanical constitutive modeling
    - To predict the Thermomechanical Behavior of SMPs using Deep Learning (Develop new thermomechanical models for SMPs).
    - Example ploymer: Semicrystalline two-way shape memory polymer (2W-SMP)
    - To know the SMP properties and validate its characteristics.
    - To find the best DL model that can predict the experiemntal thermomechanical behavior with the highest accuracy within a reasonable time frame. (FCNN and CNN were most accurate).
    - The trained model can predict the results of new iterations of the experiment.

- **Shape memory Polymers**
    - Smart materials capable of returning from a deformed shape to their original shape in response to temperature, electric field, or magnetic field.
    - Need to design new SMPs with better properties but it is difficult and time consumming because of trial and error process.

- **Thermomechanical behavior**
    - Thermomechanical behavior or thermomechanical constitutive law is not only critical for validating newly designed SMPs, it is also essential for designing load carrying structures and devices made of SMPs.

- **Background**
    - To assist in the polymer discovery process by reducing the time needed to validate newly designed SMPs.
    - To validate newly designed SMP, the researhcers need to verify whether the polymers have the desired characteristics.
    - Validate through recoverable strain and stress levels of the polymer.
    - A technique to evaluate the properties is the thermomechanical analysis (TMA).
    - **Thermomechanical Analysis (TMA)** the change in stress and strain of a material is measured in response to time, temperature and external load.
    - How the polymer will respond to different conditions and estimate the change in strain of a SMP without performing experimental TMA.
    - There was lack of predict the research of using ML to predict the thermomechanical behavior of SMPs.

- **Objective**
    - The objective is to predict the change in strain of an SMP as a function of time, temperature, and external load.
    - Since the variable to be predicted is a time dependent variable, DL models for time series forecasting are suitable to make the prediction.
